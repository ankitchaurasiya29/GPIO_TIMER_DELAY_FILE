# GPIO_TIMER_DELAY_FILE
The program consists of three files: `main.c`, `gpio.c`, and `timer.c`. The main file (`main.c`) serves as the entry point and contains the main function. It includes the necessary header files and initializes the system, GPIO, and timer configurations. The GPIO configuration is handled in `gpio.c`, where the GPIO pin is initialized as an output and provides a function to toggle the pin. The timer configuration is managed in `timer.c`, which initializes and starts a timer interrupt. When the timer interrupt occurs, it calls the GPIO's toggle function to blink an LED connected to the specified GPIO pin. By separating the GPIO and timer functionality into their respective files, the code is modular and promotes code reuse.
